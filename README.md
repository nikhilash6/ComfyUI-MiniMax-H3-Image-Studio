# MiniMax H3 Image Studio

ComfyUI nodes and workflows for MiniMax H3 text-to-image, image-to-image, and REF2VA reference editing.

MiniMax H3 is an audio-video model. These nodes generate a short frame packet, decode it, and select one still image.

## Requirements

- ComfyUI 0.30.0 or newer
- MiniMax H3 diffusion model
- MiniMax H3 Qwen text encoder
- MiniMax H3 video VAE
- Matching Turbo adapter only for a Turbo workflow

Use the [official ComfyUI MiniMax H3 guide](https://docs.comfy.org/tutorials/video/minimax/minimax-h3) for model downloads and installation.

| Recommended official model | Folder |
|---|---|
| `minimax_h3_fl2va_pruned_int8_convrot.safetensors` or `minimax_h3_ref2va_pruned_int8_convrot.safetensors` | `ComfyUI/models/diffusion_models/` |
| `qwen3vl_32b_minimax_h3_nvfp4_awq.safetensors` | `ComfyUI/models/text_encoders/` |
| `minimax_h3_video_vae_fp16.safetensors` | `ComfyUI/models/vae/` |
| Exact Turbo adapter named in the sampling table | `ComfyUI/models/loras/` |

The audio VAE is not required for image output.

## Installation

### ComfyUI Manager

Search for **MiniMax H3 Image Studio**, or run:

```bash
comfy node install minimax-h3-image-studio
```

### Git

```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/astropuzzo/ComfyUI-MiniMax-H3-Image-Studio.git
```

Restart ComfyUI after installing or updating.

To update a Git installation:

```bash
git -C ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-MiniMax-H3-Image-Studio pull --ff-only
```

## Workflows

Open a file from `examples/ui/`, or drag a file from `examples/png/` onto the canvas.

Start with **Image Generate** or **Image Edit** below. Both use a matching 768p eight-step Turbo adapter, five frames, and an approximately 1 MP canvas. **Draft** variants pair the four-step adapter with its matching sampling recipe. Image Edit uses REF2VA references rather than locking frame zero to the original image.

Set Resolution Preset to `high-res | 2.00 MP` for larger output. Four-megapixel generation and editing were also tested, but cost more and do not guarantee better composition or detail. See the [measured results and comparison images](VALIDATION.md).

Files in `examples/api/` are prompt JSON for API clients. They do not contain a canvas layout.

For image-to-image and reference-edit workflows, select an image in every `Load Image` node before running the workflow.

## Nodes

| Node | Function |
|---|---|
| `Text to Image` | Prepares FL2VA text conditioning for multi-frame or one-frame output. |
| `Image to Image` | Uses an FL2VA frame-0 anchor for multi-frame editing and REF2VA source conditioning for editable one-frame output. |
| `Reference Edit` | Prepares REF2VA editing with up to nine ordered references. |
| `Resolution Preset` | Calculates common H3 canvas sizes. |
| `Sampling Preset` | Configures documented recipes or a complete custom sampler setup. |
| `Exact Frame Decode` | Decodes the frame profile or independently decodes one latent slice with an image VAE. |
| `Single Image Output` | Selects one frame or returns the decoded batch. |
| `Advanced Resolution` | Calculates custom canvas sizes. |
| `Advanced Sampling` | Exposes sampler, scheduler, denoise, and sigma shifts. |
| `Advanced Combined Prepare` | Combines all preparation modes in one node. |
| `Detail Tone Lock` | Blends refined detail while restoring the H3 image's broad lighting and color. |

## Optional detail refinement

`H3_DETAIL_REFINER` is a separate generative image-edit pass. Load a finished H3 image, or connect any `Single Image Output` directly to `Scale Image to Total Pixels`. It is optional and does not change H3 generation.

The workflow uses ComfyUI's native Qwen Image Edit 2511 path with the four-step Lightning adapter. It can generate new detail, but may also change faces, objects, and lighting. It is not a guaranteed fidelity upgrade over the source or a faster model.

| Component | File | Folder |
|---|---|---|
| Diffusion model | `qwen_image_edit_2511_int8_convrot.safetensors` | `ComfyUI/models/diffusion_models/` |
| Text encoder | `qwen_2.5_vl_7b_fp8_scaled.safetensors` | `ComfyUI/models/text_encoders/` |
| VAE | `qwen_image_vae.safetensors` | `ComfyUI/models/vae/` |
| Four-step adapter | `Qwen-Image-Edit-2511-Lightning-4steps-V1.0-bf16.safetensors` | `ComfyUI/models/loras/` |

Downloads and setup are documented in the [official ComfyUI Qwen Image Edit 2511 guide](https://docs.comfy.org/tutorials/image/qwen/qwen-image-edit-2511). The workflow uses the official Comfy INT8 ConvRot checkpoint and the published [four-step Lightning adapter](https://huggingface.co/lightx2v/Qwen-Image-Edit-2511-Lightning).

The workflow uses Euler/simple, four steps, CFG 1, AuraFlow shift 3.1, CFG normalization 1, and a two-megapixel working copy. That working copy controls model cost only. The original H3 image goes directly to `Detail Tone Lock`, so the saved result always has the original width and height.

The prompt is intentionally generic and preservation-first. Do not append the complete H3 generation prompt by default: scene descriptions can encourage reconstruction. Describe a specific defect only when it needs repair.

`Detail Tone Lock` uses frequency separation rather than masks: Qwen supplies newly generated fine detail while H3 remains authoritative for dimensions, broad lighting, and color. The shipped defaults are `tone_lock=0.85`, `refinement_strength=0.55`, and `detail_radius=32`. This is not an upscaler or restoration-only chain; Qwen performs the second image-generation pass.

## Frame profiles

H3 processes multiple frames even when the output is one image.

| Profile | Frames | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| Single image | 1 | T2I, I2I, or REF2VA. Use the experimental image VAE and hybrid checkpoint. |
| Recommended | 5 | Default. |
| Extended | 9 | More temporal context. |
| High | 13 | Higher memory and runtime. |
| Maximum | 20 | Highest memory and runtime. |

`Exact Frame Decode` returns the selected profile and a `recommended_index`. Connect that index to `Single Image Output`.

`Single Image Output` uses the recommended index by default. Its scoring modes are optional diagnostics; they cannot correct weak conditioning or an unclear edit prompt.

## Sampling

| Profile | Sampler | Scheduler | Steps | Video/audio shift |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|
| Base quality | `res_multistep` | `simple` | 20 | 12/3 |
| Base speed | `res_multistep` | `simple` | 12 | 12/3 |
| FL2VA Turbo v1.0 | `euler` | `simple` | 8 | 12/3 |
| FL2VA Turbo v1.0 768p | `euler` | `simple` | 4 | 6/3 |
| FL2VA Turbo v1.0 768p | `euler` | `simple` | 8 | 6/3 |
| FL2VA Turbo v1.2 768p | `euler` | `simple` | 4 | 6/3 |
| REF2VA Turbo v1.0 768p | `euler` | `simple` | 8 | 12/3 |
| REF2VA Turbo v0.1 | `euler` | `simple` | 4 | 12/3 |
| Hybrid single image | `er_sde` | `sgm_uniform` | 8 | 12/3 |

Turbo profiles require the exact matching adapter below. `Sampling Preset` configures sampling but does not load a LoRA.

Choose `custom | use controls below` in `Sampling Preset` to select any installed sampler and scheduler and set steps, denoise, H3 video/audio shifts, and beta-scheduler parameters directly. The custom controls are ignored while a documented preset is selected, so loading an existing workflow preserves its exact recipe.

| Profile | Required adapter |
|---|---|
| FL2VA Turbo v1.0, 8 steps | `minimax_h3_fl2v_turbo_8step_v1.0_comfyui_bf16.safetensors` |
| FL2VA Turbo v1.0 768p, 4 steps | `minimax_h3_fl2v_turbo_4step_v1.0_768p_comfyui_bf16.safetensors` |
| FL2VA Turbo v1.0 768p, 8 steps | `minimax_h3_fl2v_turbo_8step_v1.0_768p_comfyui_bf16.safetensors` |
| FL2VA Turbo v1.2 768p, 4 steps | `minimax_h3_fl2v_turbo_4step_v1.2_768p_comfyui_bf16.safetensors` |
| REF2VA Turbo v1.0 768p, 8 steps | `minimax_h3_ref2v_turbo_8step_v1.0_768p_comfyui_bf16.safetensors` |
| REF2VA Turbo v0.1, 4 steps | `minimax_h3_ref2v_turbo_4step_v0.1_comfyui_bf16.safetensors` |

Do not mix FL2VA and REF2VA adapters or reuse one adapter's shifts with another. The older LightX v0.1 profile names remain available only to load existing workflows.

Download the adapters from [LightX2V](https://huggingface.co/lightx2v/Minimax-h3-Turbo/tree/main). The eight-step REF2VA settings follow the [author's release announcement](https://huggingface.co/lightx2v/Minimax-h3-Turbo/discussions/51): its video shift is **12**, not the FL2VA 768p value of 6.

The hybrid single-image profile reproduces the linked community workflow. It is experimental and expects the model stack listed below; it is not an official MiniMax recipe.

## Reference editing

REF2VA rebuilds an image from ordered references. Refer to each input by number:

```text
Keep the identity, face, hair, clothing, camera, and environment from <Picture 1>.
Use the body pose and limb positions from <Picture 2>. The final pose must visibly match <Picture 2>.
```

`source_fidelity` changes preservation wording for traits that the instruction does not mention. Explicit assignments such as "pose from `<Picture 2>`" take priority. It is not denoise strength. For large pose, framing, or composition transfers, start around `0.50-0.60`; higher values favor an unchanged `<Picture 1>`.

Each reference socket represents exactly one picture. If an upstream node sends an IMAGE batch, only its first image is used so later sockets keep stable `<Picture N>` numbers. State the role of every connected picture explicitly in the target instructions.

`reference_transport=native` uses both the vision encoder and VAE references. This is the default. `semantic (experimental)` sends pictures to the vision encoder only, following [ComfyUI's text-encoder-only reference path](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI/commit/1aec3a1351). It avoids VAE reference encoding and reference-latent attention, but may lose identity, exact layout, and small details. It does not reduce the size of the H3 model or text encoder. Keep the VAE connected for decoding.

The older `H3_I2I` workflow anchors frame zero to the source. With only a few frames, the result may remain close to that source. Use `H3_IMAGE_EDIT` for requested changes to objects, pose, color, or composition. No frame-selection score can determine whether a text instruction was followed; check the output visually.

### Experimental one-frame workflows

`H3_T2I_SINGLE`, `H3_I2I_SINGLE`, and `H3_REFERENCE_SINGLE` generate a true `T=1` H3 latent directly. They do not patch ComfyUI or route around Image Studio's conditioning output. Their model stack follows the community workflow:

| Component | File |
|---|---|
| Hybrid diffusion model | `minimax_h3_hybrid_fl2va_ref2va_b25-49-int8.safetensors` |
| Image VAE | `minimax_h3_t1_image_vae_step1597.safetensors` |
| Turbo adapter | `minimax_h3_fl2v_turbo_8step_v1.0_comfyui_bf16.safetensors`, strength 0.75 |
| Detail adapter | `MaxiMin-HHH-R2V-ThisIsFine_LoRA_V0_1.safetensors`, strength 0.5 |

The image VAE is intended only for one-frame output. Keep `minimax_h3_video_vae_fp16.safetensors` for multi-frame workflows. The hybrid checkpoint, image VAE, and detail adapter are community experiments and inherit their source-model licenses.

The detail adapter is set to `0.5` based on an earlier pose-transfer experiment. This is not a general guarantee: one-frame editing and adapter combinations remain experimental.

The v23 tests reproduced visible pose and jacket changes with these workflows at 1 and 2 MP. They also exposed unwanted white borders in one single-frame generation. Keep the five-frame workflows as the starting point when reliability matters. More frames are not automatically higher quality; the profile labels are retained for saved-workflow compatibility.

One-frame T2I uses the hybrid checkpoint's FL2VA base without an image reference. One-frame I2I cannot use FL2VA's exact frame-0 keyframe because that keyframe would occupy the only output frame; Image Studio automatically switches that case to Picture 1 reference conditioning. Multi-frame I2I continues to use the original FL2VA keyframe path.

Downloads: [hybrid checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/smhfacct/Minimax-H3-fl2va-ref2va-hybrid-models), [single-image VAE](https://huggingface.co/Mamad8/MiniMax-H3-Image-VAE), [ThisIsFine adapter](https://huggingface.co/Mamad8/MaxiMin-HHH-R2V-ThisIsFine), and [Turbo adapter](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/MiniMax-H3/tree/main/loras).

The approach was prompted by the [single-image community workflow](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1vqka28/h3_singleimage_no_more_monkey_patching_also_no/). ComfyUI main subsequently added conversion from a regular empty image latent in [commit `0696f61`](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI/commit/0696f61dced6340086cdca64a96200c50f306c66). Image Studio builds the correct nested H3 video/audio latent itself, so its one-frame profile also works on ComfyUI 0.33.1 without that core commit.

## Independent image-VAE decoding

You can keep five-frame sampling and still use an image VAE: add a second `Load VAE`, connect it **only** to `Exact Frame Decode`, select `single_latent_slice`, and choose latent index 0 or 1. Keep the official video VAE connected to Reference Edit for encoding. Index 1 is not video frame 1; it is the second compressed temporal slice. Keep `spatial_decode=native` initially. `full_image (experimental)` follows whole-image decoding and uses more VRAM; it can introduce patch artifacts.

The existing Mamad8 image VAE works with this path. The newer [500K decoder](https://huggingface.co/iamkaikai/MiniMax-H3-Single-Frame-VAE-500K) is **not a recommended upgrade**: the tested generated portrait showed patch artifacts both in native ComfyUI conversion and in the author's pinned Diffusers implementation. Changing the VAE does not repair failed edit conditioning.

For reproducibility, `scripts/convert_single_frame_decoder.py` combines the author's decoder-only checkpoint with the official FP16 VAE encoder. It checks the decoder checksum, maps every tensor, interleaves QKV heads and swaps the SwiGLU halves. It refuses to overwrite an existing file. Weights are not redistributed. Run in the ComfyUI Python environment:

```bash
python scripts/convert_single_frame_decoder.py --base /models/vae/minimax_h3_video_vae_fp16.safetensors --decoder /downloads/minimax_h3_single_frame_decoder_500k.safetensors --output /models/vae/minimax_h3_image_vae_500k_comfy_fp16.safetensors
```

Review the model's license before use. This conversion is for experimental independent image decoding, not video output.

## Resolution and memory

Resolution is rounded to a 32-pixel grid. `1 MP` follows ComfyUI's `1024²` convention.

The native H3 canvas is about 1344×768, or one megapixel. Start at 0.70 MP; use 0.40 MP for quick composition tests or 0.98 MP for more detail. A 2 MP canvas increases memory and runtime and is not a general quality upgrade.

## Performance

See [v22 validation](VALIDATION.md) for local timings, visual findings, and limitations. The default remains native references; semantic mode is not consistently faster.

- Prefer the official pruned INT8 ConvRot diffusion model and NVFP4 text encoder listed above. The Comfy model card recommends the INT8 ConvRot model on current CUDA/PyTorch builds and FP8 only as a fallback.
- Compare Turbo results against the base 20-step profile when quality matters. Distilled video adapters are not trained specifically for these short still-image packets.
- SageAttention is optional. ComfyUI's H3 guide reports roughly double sampling speed with minimal quality loss. Enable it globally with ComfyUI's `--use-sage-attention` option or a compatible attention node, not both.
- Match FL2VA source images to the generation canvas for lower preprocessing cost. In REF2VA, `match` is faster; the 2048-short-edge option can strengthen identity at higher cost.
- Change one optimization at a time and compare with the same seed. Stacking unrelated caches, attention patches, and distilled adapters can reduce detail or introduce incompatibilities.

Experimental W4A8 diffusion and INT8 ConvRot VAE variants require ComfyUI 0.31 or newer. They are not workflow defaults because hardware support and output behavior vary.

### Model storage and Hugging Face cache

ComfyUI's `extra_model_paths.yaml` controls additional model search folders. Hugging Face's cache is separate: set `HF_HOME` to a folder on the disk with free space before launching ComfyUI. If previously configured, also update `HF_HUB_CACHE` and `HF_XET_CACHE`. See the [official cache settings](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/package_reference/environment_variables).

Downloading with `hf download ... --local-dir <model-folder>` places the usable file directly in that folder; the folder also contains small download metadata. Explicit download paths can override environment settings. Do not delete or move a cache while downloads or model loads are running.

### Receiving updates

Git installations receive changes after a pull and ComfyUI restart. Registry installations receive numbered releases through ComfyUI Manager once the Registry finishes publishing and its cache refreshes. A successful GitHub push does not by itself make a Registry release available. Reopen the new example workflows after updating; saved canvases do not automatically acquire new nodes or recipes.

## Troubleshooting

### `H3WorkflowNote` is reported as missing

This node was added in v15. Update MiniMax H3 Image Studio, restart ComfyUI, and refresh the browser. Current bundled workflows no longer depend on documentation-note nodes.

### A sampling profile or selector strategy is not in the list

Errors mentioning `Turbo v1.0 | 8 steps`, `base quality | RES 20 steps`, or `decode_recommended` mean that a current workflow reached an older backend. Updating files without restarting ComfyUI does not replace the node definitions already loaded in memory.

1. Update MiniMax H3 Image Studio.
2. Stop every running ComfyUI process.
3. Start ComfyUI again.
4. Reload the browser page.
5. Reopen the workflow from `examples/ui/` or `examples/png/`.

Do not repair this by changing only the rejected values. The current decoder also provides the `recommended_index` output used by the workflow.

### `Load Image - image` is missing

Select an input file in each `Load Image` node. This is required for image-to-image and reference editing.

### The canvas is empty

Use a file from `examples/ui/` or `examples/png/`. Files in `examples/api/` are not canvas workflows.

### ComfyUI reports deprecated frontend imports

This extension imports only ComfyUI's supported `scripts/app.js` frontend module. Update the other custom nodes named in the warning or disable them one at a time to identify the source.

### Reporting a generation error

Open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/astropuzzo/ComfyUI-MiniMax-H3-Image-Studio/issues) and include:

- complete console traceback
- ComfyUI and Image Studio versions
- operating system, GPU, VRAM, and system RAM
- model and LoRA filenames
- workflow JSON or metadata PNG
- resolution, frame profile, sampler, scheduler, and steps

Do not post private prompts, tokens, or personal images.
